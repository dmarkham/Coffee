# Dominican Republic Jarabacoa Small Lot Coffee - Trader Joes


### Description

Jarabacoa, located in the central region of the Dominican Republic, is home to third-generation coffee farmers who are dedicated to the cultivation of high-quality coffee beans. For this small-lot selection, these farmers harvest 100% Arabica coffee cherries, then refine their skins and pulp. Normally, the sticky-sweet outer layer of the coffee fruit is washed off, but these beans are “honey processed,” so that layer is left intact. Because they spend less time in water, the sun-dried beans ferment less and retain more natural sweetness.

Trader Joe’s Dominican Republic Jarabacoa Small Lot Coffee wears its honey process on its sip. Immediately, a taster can detect a subtle sweetness, accompanied by notes of chocolate and hints of blackberry. The honeyed profile pairs wonderfully with sweet breakfast pastries, like Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Ginger Scones. Sip it in the afternoon with a dunk of an Apple Cider Donut, or enjoy it after dinner, affogato style, with a scoop of Trader Joe’s Salted Maple Ice Cream.
