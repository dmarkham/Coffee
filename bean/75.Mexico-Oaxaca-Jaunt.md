San Vicente Yogondoy is a lush, densely forested, isolated, and remote community near San Agustin Loxicha in the Sierra Sur region of Oaxaca. The steep slopes where coffee grows under a dense native shade canopy, face the Pacific Ocean to the south, and receive very distinct rainy and dry seasons with cooling breezes off of the Pacific. The indigenous Zapotec community still maintains their language and describe the area as the Rio de Abejas (Beesâ€™ River), the translation for Yogondoy in Zapotec. Tellingly, many of the coffee farmers also maintain beehives and produce honey. Many of the farmers in this area have younger coffee trees which were planted within the last five years and are continuing the tradition of maintaining almost 100% Pluma variety, the local mutation of Typica being grown for over 80 years that thrives in these conditions, soils, and climate.
