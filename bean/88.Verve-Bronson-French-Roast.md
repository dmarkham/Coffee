Their take on French Roast. Enjoy silky dark chocolate and raw sugar sweetness with their darkest roast. It pairs well with cream and sugar. Anyone who enjoys an extra bold coffee will love this.

Aptly named, the Bronson French Roast is Verve's darkest profile, capitalizing on caramelization to achieve a dark sugar sweetness capable of only high-grown specialty coffees.

Available in 12 OZ, 2.2 LBS, 5 LBS, 6 OZ sizes.
