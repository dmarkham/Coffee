Rich, sweet, and comforting, Amsterdam is the perfect drip coffee option for those who seek a deeper roast profile. Joe Coffee selects the components for this coffee for their ability to stand up to a more developed roast, without ever tasting over-roasted or smoky. Instead, they pull out classic notes of chocolate, nut, and toffee.

Part of Joe Coffee's One City Collection, Amsterdam is built from Rainforest Alliance Certified coffees from Veloso Coffee, a family-run operation that has been producing specialty coffees in the Cerrado region of Minas Gerais, Brazil for decades. The Veloso family utilizes both traditional wisdom and sustainable innovation in their coffee cultivation, including GPS technology for harvest scheduling.
