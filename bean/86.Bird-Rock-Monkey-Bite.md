Dive into the heart of Bird Rock Coffee Roasters with their signature Monkey Bite Espresso. This blend is sweet, complex, and a perfect example of modern third-wave espresso. It's the same blend used in all their retail cafes.

Named for a harrowing monkey attack their founder Chuck suffered in Kenya, this blend is a top seller. It's carefully crafted and tested to be delicious as straight espresso, drip coffee, or in milk-based drinks.
